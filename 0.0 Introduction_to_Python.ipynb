    "### What is Python?\n",
    "Python is an open-source, modern, robust, high level programming language. Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is open-source? \n",
    "Open-Source code is original source code made freely available and which may be redistributed and modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Modern?\n",
    "Released in 1991, making it one of the younger languages, (and a millenial)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why so robust? \n",
    "In Computer Science, robustness is the ability of a computer system to cope with errors during execution and cope with erroneous input. Python features a dynamic type system (interpreting code line by line) and automatic memory management, making it ideal for quick prototyping as well as constructing large, complicated systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What does high-level language even mean? \n",
    "A high-level language (HLL) is a programming language that enables a programmer to write programs that are more or less independent of a particular type of computer. Such languages are considered high-level because they are closer to human languages and further from machine languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "More general programinning lingo can be found at https://hackernoon.com/i-finally-understand-static-vs-dynamic-typing-and-you-will-too-ad0c2bd0acc7\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very easy to pick up Python even if you are completely new to programming. (I'll prove it to you!)"

    "*See Notebooks 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 for optional tutorials on these three libraries, which you can work through whenever you have time.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib.pyplot are arguably the most useful tools available to any scientist, and just with these three libraries you can do incredible things. We import the libraries we'll be making use of at the top of our script, always. We don't import unnecessary libraries as they all take up memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Numpy\n",
    "NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. More information found at http://www.numpy.org\n",
    "Numpy provides\n",
    "  1. An array object of arbitrary homogeneous items\n",
    "  2. Fast mathematical operations over arrays\n",
    "  3. Linear Algebra, Fourier Transforms, Random Number Generation (And Statistical Tools)\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Pandas\n",
    "Pandas is the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. More found at https://pandas.pydata.org\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Easy handling of missing data in floating point as well as non-floating point data\n",
    "  - Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects\n",
    "  - Automatic and explicit data alignment: objects can  be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically align the data for you in\n",
    "    computations\n",
    "  - Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data\n",
    "  - Make it easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects\n",
    "  - Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets\n",
    "  - Intuitive merging and joining data sets\n",
    "  - Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets\n",
    "  - Hierarchical labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick)\n",
    "  - Robust IO tools for loading data from flat files (CSV and delimited), Excel files, databases, and saving/loading data from the ultrafast HDF5 format\n",
    "  - Time series-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear regressions, date shifting and lagging, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matplotlib.pyplot\n",
    "Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible. You can generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, errorcharts, scatterplots, etc., with just a few lines of code.

An *If Statement* is often accompanied by an *Else Statement*, where the code in the *Else Statement* will execute if the *If Statement* did not. We also get something called an *Elif Statement*, short for \"Else If\" which basically starts a new If statement, but only if the first *If Statement* did not execute.\n",
