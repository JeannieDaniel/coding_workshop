    "\n",
    "### A:\n",
    "A chatbot (also known as a talkbot, chatterbot, Bot, IM bot, interactive agent, or Artificial Conversational Entity) is a computer program or an artificial intelligence which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner, thereby passing the Turing test. \n",
    "\n",
    "Chatbots are typically used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some chatterbots use sophisticated natural language processing systems, but many simpler systems scan for keywords within the input, then pull a reply with the most matching keywords, or the most similar wording pattern, from a database."

    "Many companies are hoping to develop bots to have natural conversations indistinguishable from human ones, and many claim to be using NLP and Deep Learning techniques to make this possible."

    "\n",
    "All of this can be done using webscraping. Webscraping means to automatically scrape information from publically-available website. A website is characterised by its URL, or its virtual address. \n",
    "\n",

Then we start using Spiders, which crawl across the site, mimicking the way an user would scroll through the site. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in websites in general, check out https://www.w3schools.com/html/. Here you can learn all about the different attributes of HTML, and how they interact. \n",
