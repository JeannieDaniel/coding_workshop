    "### A:\n",
    "A chatbot (also known as a talkbot, chatterbot, Bot, IM bot, interactive agent, or Artificial Conversational Entity) is a computer program or an artificial intelligence which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner, thereby passing the Turing test. \n",
    "\n",
    "Chatbots are typically used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some chatterbots use sophisticated natural language processing systems, but many simpler systems scan for keywords within the input, then pull a reply with the most matching keywords, or the most similar wording pattern, from a database."

    "\n",
    "All of this can be done using webscraping. Webscraping means to automatically scrape information from publically-available website. A very easy-to-use tool is called BeautifulSoup, which parses the HTML into its objects. Here is  cool tutorial on how BeautifulSoup works: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-scrape-websites-with-python-and-beautifulsoup-5946935d93fe. A website is characterised by its URL, or its virtual address. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of websites, static and dynamic. Static websites are really easy to scrape, the content is embedded in the HTML. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic websites get populated only once the page loads (i.e. user scrolls down or something), so it is a lot harder to scrape the website using static tools like BeautifulSoup. Then we start using Spiders, which crawl across the site, mimicking the way an user would scroll through the site. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in websites in general, check out https://www.w3schools.com/html/. Here you can learn all about the different attributes of HTML, and how they interact. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually the most interesting stuff is found within divs. We can treat the HTML like one massive string and split the HTML using keywords and pattern matching."

    "Collecting news from Moneyweb means we scrape the whole HTML page (the language that websites are made of), and strip away the unnecessary stuff to leave us with only the headlines. We do this using BeautifulSoup, a package specifically for parsing HTML. \n",
